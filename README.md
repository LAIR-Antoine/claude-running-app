# Claude Running App

During a lesson, we had to asked Claude AI to make an Android app for us. I decided to remake an app I already did in the past with React Native, who took me a long time and was functional but not really user friendly. 

So this app was fully generate with Claude based on this first prompt and few chats to improve things after.
```
I want you to create a simple Android app that will help me in running. 
I need different calculator to get a pace from distance and time, a distance for pace and time and a time from distance and pace. 
I also need a converter between pace and speed.

I want you to use km as distance unit, h:mm:ss for time, km/h for speed and mm:ss/km for pace
```

Claude decided to use Kotlin and I never used it before and without any skills, it's possible to code an Android app, build it and run it on a real phone.

You can find the APK  in ```app/release/app-release.apk```.

If you want to see the steps, I joined the V1 of the app too here ```app/release/first-app-release.apk```.
